                        <p> The ankh or key of life is an ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic symbol 
                        that was most commonly used in writing and in Egyptian art to represent 
                        the word for `life` and, by extension, as a symbol of life itself. </p>

                     falcon, most likely a lanner or peregrine falcon. His right eye was associated
                      the sun god, Ra.The eye symbol represents the marking around the eye of the falcon, 
                      including the "teardrop" marking sometimes found below the eye.The mirror image, 
                      or left eye, sometimes represented the moon and the god Djehuti ().    </p>             </div>
