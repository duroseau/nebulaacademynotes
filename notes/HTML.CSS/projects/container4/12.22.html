            <p>Objective:Is simple, send me as much cash that
                that you can get a hold on. I will jump on an 
                airplane to the nearest Casino, find a baccarat
                table with a fine young lady dealing. I will sit
                down and order martinis (shaken and not stirred)
                I can most likely triple your money, but will only
                return half (I have expenses). If I happen to lose
                your money, please understand (we all have bad days)
                I am also a loanshark, I will loan you cash at 44% 
                interest(some credit cards charge 45%) so run and 
                sell, borrow or steal as much as you can muster and
                click on the link and pray for the best. Please read
                disclaimer below and remember anything under $5000
                is not worth my time.
            </p>
